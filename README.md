# Development Assignment

## Instructions
You will be developing a React.js app called Eventio which allows registered users to sign up for and create events. The app has to contain 6 pages: Login, Sign Up, Events List, Event Detail, Create Event, User Profile

## Progress
Commit all your changes to a `dev` branch. When you are ready to submit your assignment for a review, create a `pull request` from `dev` to `master` and in the right column select your mentor as a reviewer. You can find your mentor [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/15yT3F4OtwyqCiow9syuPS9vqaanjlHJcHKSkExQgvhA/edit#gid=1544649426).
